## About Clesperanto

The clesperanto project is a multi-language and multi-platform framework for GPU-accelerated image processing. It aims in removing language barriers in the scientific image analysis community by proposing a unified interface API for different programming languages and Frameworks, which rely on a common backend library accelerated by GPU.

The project is organised in a set of core-reposiroty dedicated to the low-level functionning of the project, and a set of sattelite repositories corresponding to a different programming language or framework.


## Repositories and responsabilities

Clesperanto tries to offer at the same time:
- a unified API for image processing library for different programming languages and frameworks
- a complete operation librairy for image processing and analysis accelerated by GPU
- a compatibility with most known and used hardware and system in used

To achieve this goal, the project is organised in various repository listed below with a brief description:

## How we work together

clEsperanto is developed as a community effort in the open because we believe in the open source community. Contributions like feedback, suggestions, code and testing are very welcome. This can be done through github issue, pull requests, or via [image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/) using the tag `clesperanto`.

The clesperanto project is maintained and lead as a [benevolent dictatorship](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel) by [Stephane Rigaud](https://github.com/strigaud) and [Robert Haase](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf).

Contribution are very welcome. Please read our [community guidelines](./code_of_conduct.md) before you start, and do not hesitate to get in touch with us so that we can help you get started. Each repository has its own contribution guidelines, so please check them out before you start and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any question, we are happy to help!

Regular and committed contributors will be welcomed as core contributors and will be thrusted with advanced rights and will be included in the project's decisions making.
