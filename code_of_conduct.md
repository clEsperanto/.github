# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This code of conduct applies to all repositories and spaces managed by the clesperanto project, including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, social network, forums, and any other communication channel used by our community. In-person events organised by the clesperanto project or related to our community should have a code of conduct similar in spirit to this one.

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in the clesperanto community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.

## Expected Behavior

All contributors, collaborators, and community members are expected to:

- Be respectful and considerate of others.
- Be open to collaboration and differing viewpoints.
- Be constructive and provide useful feedback.
- Be patient and understanding with others, especially when there are disagreements.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, discrimination, or any form of unwelcome conduct based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other characteristic.
- Offensive or disrespectful comments.
- Intimidation or threats.
- Personal attacks.
- Unsolicited or inappropriate sexual attention.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Inappropriate or offensive content, including in code, documentation, or discussions.
- Public or private harassment.
- Any other behavior that is harmful or disruptive to our community.

## Diversity statement

The clesperanto project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individualâ€™s preferences, we try our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability, to the extent that these do not conflict with this code of conduct.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, clesperanto development is conducted in English.

Standards for behaviour in the clesperanto community are detailed in the Code of Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these standards in all their interactions and help others to do so as well.
